Methods for the analysis and visualization of patterns of TE evolution.


**OVERVIEW**

Every script contains documentation or at least some minimal usage information. To find out the usage of a particular script just type "perl" followed by the script name. For example,

    perl meryl.pl

**INSTALLATION**

All scripts require Perl version 5.10 and some use non-core Perl modules. Though, there are no dependencies that cannot be installed from CPAN. To get the scripts, simply download the zip version of the repo, or use git:

    git clone https://github.com/sestaton/sesbio.git

After that, you can use the scripts in place and run `git pull` in the base directory to keep things up to date. Send me a message if you have feature requests or run into any issues, but be aware this is all free software and there are no guarantees (see below).
